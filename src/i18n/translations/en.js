    title: "About Palimar",
    content: "Palimaru, a village in Udupi taluk of Karnataka's coastal region, holds significant historical and religious importance. The name Palimaru is believed to have originated from the term 'Phalabharapura', referring to the abundance of fruits in the region. Sri Madhvacharya, a prominent philosopher and proponent of the Dvaita Vedanta tradition, initiated eight of his disciples into asceticism to propagate the teachings and worship of Lord Krishna. The first of these mathas (monasteries) was established in Palimaru, where the idols of Sri Vedavyasa and Sri Anjaneya were installed. Devotees have immense faith in these deities, visiting the matha in large numbers. Palimaru is home to four main temples:  1)Sri Mahalingeshwara Temple, 2)Sri Vishnumurthy Temple, 3)Chavadi Sri Brahmalingeshwara Temple, 4)Baramadi Sri Subrahmanya Temple .Among these, the Sri Subrahmanya Temple in Baramadi is unique. The Subrahmanya idol was brought here in the 12th or 13th century by the Santraya family from Santur. The area around the temple is known as Baramadi, meaning 'The place where the deity was welcomed.'"
